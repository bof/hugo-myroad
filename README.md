# hugo-myroad - my own hugo theme

This is a work in progress. I'm getting started using hugo for some personal
blog usage, and as it is with us programmers, there's always stuff to fiddle
with and change which upstreams probably won't want, things to incorporate
from different sources, yadda yadda. So, that's why.

If I ever get around to feeling somewhat "finished" with this theme, I'll
take some time to extract or write anew some documentation, too. For now,
see "Attribution" below with links to the places I shamelessly stole from,
and read *their* documentation.

## Attribution

The theme is based on [vimux/Mainroad](https://github.com/vimux/Mainroad).
Right now pretty much all html, js, css is from there. I've been reworking
the template structure a bit, trying to make sense of baseof/block/define...

Regarding license, I'm putting this work under GPLv2, as that is what
vimux uses for his Mainroad theme.
